 Describe the four basic elements of 
 counter-controlled iteration.
 */

 /*
Counter-controlled iteration involves four basic elements:

* Initialization: In this step, you initialize the loop control variable (often called a counter)
 to an initial value before the loop begins. This is typically done before the loop starts executing.

* Condition: The loop condition determines whether the loop should continue executing or terminate.
 It is evaluated before each iteration of the loop. If the condition evaluates to true, 
 the loop body is executed; otherwise, the loop terminates.

* Update: After each iteration of the loop body, the loop control variable is updated to progress 
 towards the termination condition. This update is crucial to avoid infinite loops and to ensure 
 that the loop terminates eventually.

* Loop Body: The loop body contains the statements that are executed repeatedly as 
long as the loop condition remains true. It typically performs some task or computation 
based on the current value of the loop control variable.

 These elements work together to control the flow of execution in a loop, 
 allowing you to repeat a sequence of statements a specific number of times determined 
 by the loop control variable.
